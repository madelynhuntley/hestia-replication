Replicate the Wordpress Hestia Theme, linked below

- I want everything as close to perfect as you can get it.
- You will need to utilize nearly all of the concepts we've gone over so far.
- Use SCSS instead of pure css
  - You can use just one stylesheet to avoid the hassle of the preprocessor if you want.
- All Pages should be represented if there are links to them.
- I want to see at least 1 of each of the following:
- variable
- mixin
- flexbox
- grid
- pseudo selectors (hover and focus are probably the two big ones)
- media queries
- imported fonts (try to match theirs as best you can if available)
- font awesome icon
  These requirements will probably come naturally based on that layout anyways. Don't just limit yourself to 1 though, really stretch yourself.
- I want this to look good on mobile. You do NOT have to have the hamburger icon dropdown menu be functional, come up with a creative solution instead.
- You should be pushing your code to github as you go along, but you can also submit your live Netlify link to me.
